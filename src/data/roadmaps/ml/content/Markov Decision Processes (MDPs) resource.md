#  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) resource
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are mathematical models that are used to solve decision-making problems that involve partially random and partially controllable outcomes. MDPs are widely used in many fields such as economics, engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
In an MDP, a decision-maker makes decisions in a sequence of discrete time steps. At each time step, the decision-maker observes the current state of the system and selects an action to take. The system then transitions to a new state with a certain probability, and the decision-maker receives a reward based on the state and the action taken. The goal of the decision-maker is to maximize the cumulative reward over the entire sequence of time steps

# Reinforcement Learning with Intrinsic Motivation resource

Reinforcement learning with intrinsic motivation has become a popular research topic in recent years due to its potential to enhance the performance of RL algorithms. In this blog, we will discuss the concept of intrinsic motivation, its importance in reinforcement learning, and some useful resources to learn more about it.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The rewardsignal is provided by the environment, and the agent's goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. However, in many real-world scenarios, the reward signal may not be available or may be sparse. In such cases, the agent has to explore the environment to find the reward, which can be a time-consuming and inefficient process.
